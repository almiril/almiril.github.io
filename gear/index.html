        <button class="section" onclick="unhide('general')">About this page and general gearing tips</button><br>
        <div class="guide" id="general" style="display: none;">
        <h4>What is this and who is this for?</h4>
        <p>This page is mostly for casual players who want to do the most recent extreme fights, or who want to dip their toes into savage raids without willing to commit to getting their Best In Slot gearsets. 
            So this guide will assume you don't have access to gear from savage raids, but they will be mentioned just to be complete.</p>
        <p>This page will also not go over materia melds, if you do want to know what to meld, check <a href="https://thebalanceffxiv.com/" target="_blank">The Balance's Discord</a>, or just ask someone who knows what they're doing.</p>
        <h4>What to prioritize when gearing up</h4>
        <p>Generally you should always prioritize item level (ilvl) What this means is that, in this patch, you should always be working towards getting Augmented Crystarium gear.</p>
        <p>When it comes to upgrading individual pieces, upgrading your weapon is generally the highest priority, after that the top/bottoms, then hat/gloves/shoes, then belt/accessories.</p>
        <p>If you have any comments or corrections, or if something is unclear, feel free to ping me on Discord.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="section" onclick="unhide('types')">An explanation of gear types, and where to get them</button><br>
            <div class="guide" id="types" style="display: none;">There are a few types of "current" gear<br>
                <h4>Crafted (Neo-Ishgardian) Gear</h4>
                <p>This is ilvl 480 gear that can be upgraded to ilvl 490<br>
                You can obtain this gear either by crafting it yourself (you will need the latest mastercraft books), 
                by buying them off the market board (search for "Neo-Ishgardian"), 
                or by having someone craft them for you. <b>Make sure this is HQ gear</b>, NQ gear is worth 20 ilvls less.</p>
                <h4>Tomestone (Crystarium) Gear</h4>
                <p>This is ilvl 490 gear that can be upgraded to ilvl 500<br>
                You can obtain this gear by exchanging tomestones of allegory to <button class="location" onclick="unhide('aymark')">Aymark</button> in Eulmore<br>
                <div id="aymark" style="display: none;"><img src="img/aymarkpos.png" alt="Aymark's location"></div>
                These tomestones can be obtained by completing certain duties and duty roulettes, but you can only acquire 450 of them per week.</p>
                <h4>Primal Weapons</h4>
                <p>These are ilvl 495 weapons that can be gotten as a drop from the latest extreme primal, or traded for the totems that drop from it at a rate of 10 totems per weapon.<br> 
                    The totems can be traded to <button class="location" onclick="unhide('fathard')">Fathard</button> in Eulmore by selecting his "Totem Gear (Warrior of Light)" dialog option.
                <div id="fathard" style="display: none;"><img src="img/fathard.png" alt="Fathard's location"></div></p>
                <h4>Savage (Edenchoir) Gear</h4>
                <p>This is ilvl 500 gear with ilvl 505 weapons that can be gotten either from gear coffer drops or book tokens that can be gotten from Eden's Verse Savage fights.</p>
                <!--<h4>Relic Weapons</h4>
                <p>These are currently ilvl 485, so only get these if you have 1000 poetics to burn, don't have any other way to get a weapon of a higher ilvl, and are desperate. This section may be updated on patch 5.35.</p> -->
            </div>
        <button class="section" onclick="unhide('crafted')">Upgrading crafted (Neo-Ishgardian) gear</button><br>
        <div class="guide" id="crafted" style="display: none;">
            <p>This is done at <button class="location" onclick="unhide('hillicen')">Hillicen</button> in Eulmore.
            <div id="hillicen" style="display: none;"><img src ="img/hillicen.png" alt="hillicen"></div>
            Hillicen has too many menu options, so let's focus on the important ones:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rain exchange:</b><br>This is where you trade tomestones of Phantasmagoria for <b>Undersea Rain</b>. Ignore the Kholusian rain</li>
                <li><b>Earn Eulmoran Certificates of Novelty (HQ):</b><br>This has a few sub-sections where you trade in your crafted gear for <b>Eulmoran Certificates of Novelty</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Purchase Augmented Neo-Ishgardian Equipment:</b><br>This has a few sub-sections where you can trade Undersea Rain and Eulmoran Certificates of Novelty for your upgraded gear.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b><u>So how do you actually upgrade your gear?</u></b><br><ul>
            <li>First off, take note of which items you want to upgrade.<br></li>
            <li>Next, in <b>Rain Exchange</b>, trade tomestones of Phantasmagoria for the amount of Undersea Rain you need to upgrade those pieces of gear.<br>
            You'll need:
            <ul>
                <li>7 Rain per Weapon</li>
                <li>5 Rain per Top/Pants each</li>
                <li>3 Rain per Hat/Gloves/Shoes each</li>
                <li>2 Rain per Accessory/Belt each</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Once you have the appropriate amount of Rain, go to <b>Earn Eulmoran Certificates of Novelty (HQ)</b> and select the options that correspond with the gear you want to upgrade.
            Make sure you hover over the gear icons to make sure you're trading in the right items.</li>
            <li>Finally, go to <b>Purchase Augmented Neo-Ishgardian Equipment</b>, and with the Certificates and Rain you got from the previous two steps, buy the Augmented Neo-Ishgardian gear pieces you want, again making sure to hover over the icon to make absolutely sure that it is the right piece you're buying.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <button class="section" onclick="unhide('tomestone')">Upgrading tomestone (Crystarium) gear</button><br>
        <div class="guide" id="tomestone" style="display: none;">
            <p>This is done at <button class="location" onclick="unhide('sheetatch')">Shee-Tatch</button> in Eulmore.
            <div id="sheetatch" style="display: none;"><img src ="img/sheetatch.png" alt="Shee-Tatch"></div>
            Upgrading this gear is done in the 3 Crystarium Gear Augmentation sections, and to do so you will need:
            <ul><li>1 Crystalline Ester per weapon</li>
                <li>1 Crystalline Twine per hat/chest/gloves/pants/shoes</li>
                <li>1 Crystalline Glaze per accessory/belt</li></ul>
            There are a few ways to get these items:
            <h4>Alliance Raids</h4>
            <p>Once per week you will get a Manufactured Coin on completion of the Copied Factory Alliance Raid, and a Puppet's Coin on completion of the Puppet's Bunker Alliance Raid.
                You can trade these for Crystalline Twine or Crystalline Glaze at <button class="location" onclick="unhide('fathard2')">Fathard</button>in Eulmore.
                <div id="fathard2" style="display: none;"><img src="img/fathard.png" alt="Fathard's location"></div></p>
            <h4>Hunts</h4>
            <p>By doing hunts you can acquire Sacks Of Nuts, which can be traded in at Clan Nutsy Members in the <button class="location" onclick="unhide('xylle')">Crystarium</button>
                <div id="xylle" style="display: none;"><img src ="img/xylle.png" alt="Xylle"></div> 
                and <button class="location" onclick="unhide('ilfroy')">Eulmore</button>
                <div id="ilfroy" style="display: none;"><img src ="img/ilfroy.png" alt="Ilfroy"></div></p>
                <p>These can then be exchanged for Crystalline Twine (3000 Sacks of Nuts) <br>and Crystalline Glaze (2000 Sacks of Nuts)</p>
            <h4>Savage Raids</h4>
            <p>Crystalline Ester, Twine, and Glaze can be gotten directly as weekly loot from Eden's Verse (Savage) raids, or traded for Books of Furor or Books of Iconoclasm.<br>
                <u><b>This is currently the only way to get Crystalline Ester</b></u>, but it will likely be obtainable via the other two means later in the patch.
